# Papr-template

A beautiful and minimalistic template for Microsoft Word because it's not 2003 anymore ðŸ¤­.

## Installation

âš  **You have to do this in the correct order!**

1. Install the fonts - Just drag and drop them into `%windir%\Fonts`

2. Set Word to save fonts with documents. Before you download this file open Word and go to File -> Options -> Save -> "Preserve fidelity when sharing this document". Check "**Embed fonts in the file**".

3. If you have Office 2016 or newer, and you want the template available as a default, just copy the dotx file to `%userprofile%\Documents\Custom Office Templates`. Or you can just download and open it.

## Settings in Word you should use with this

Make sure you embed the fonts in the file. If not, the document will be incorrectly displayed if the document is opened on a computer that does not have the fonts installed.

Make sure to set Word to not compress images in the file. We want to retain the original image quality.

When/if you export the document to a PDF, make sure that you chose "Optimize for image quality" during the export options.
